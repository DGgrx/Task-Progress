# Task Progress

I downloaded Kicad and searched for articles regarding PWM using Arduino. I found these interesting links in the process:

* https://www.youtube.com/c/PlumPot/playlists (KiCad Playlist)
* https://www.arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Tutorial/SecretsOfArduinoPWM (Arduino PWM)
* https://forum.arduino.cc/t/pwm-for-a-complete-noob/341473/9
* https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/bitwise-operators/bitwiseand/
* https://krprojects.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/arduino-timers/

I understood how PWM is working. Understood Normal mode, Clear Timer on Compare Match (CTC) Mode and Fast PWM.

In terms of the light follower i added the elements in the schematic and have to proceed further.
